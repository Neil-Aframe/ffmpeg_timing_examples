# Some ffmpeg timing oddities 

I am sharing these as part of a bug report. I am faced with some subtle but persistent timing issues when transcoding
videos for a web site using ffmpeg, to h264, aac, mp4.

FFMPEG support ticket: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/5935

Typically output videos have a change to duration (all durations were confirmed with ffprobe - other tools may give
more details, including duration per stream, offsets in container etc), which increases by a small amount
(e.g. 0.02s or 0.04s for example inputs here). Also when played back in HTML5 player, the videos will seek inaccurately,
usually lagging behind expected display by one frame. It
is the second issue which is more serious to the work I am attempting, but the duration glitch might be a clue as to
what is going on.

It has been hard to reduce this fault to a single issue. These examples capture some of the variation I have seen, and I hope 
they will be useful in tracing a cause.

## Contents

### .sh files

These shell scripts are the commands used to create the video files, and check duration.

### .html files

Each file is a small test harness for one of the playable output videos, with a summary of results and a player window with
javascript that attempts to seek to specific frames. The javascript and HTML is identical in each file for the seek code, but
not factored out to shared code at this time.

### .log file

The file ffmpeg-20161109-161805.log is an example log from the "most broken" example i.e. ffmpeg encoding
to h264 with aac in mp4 container. This result (added duration and off-by-one frame seeking)
is closest to typical output when transcoding videos from customer sources.

## ffmpeg version

This version was used to create samples in the repository.

```

  libpostproc    54.  1.100 / 54.  1.100
```

I have also confirmed the same results with latest dev version, installed using Homebrew:

```
brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-sdl2 --with-freetype --with-libass --with-libquvi --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opus --with-x265 --HEAD
```

Which outputs version data:

```

  libpostproc    54.  2.100 / 54.  2.100
```

The file ffmpeg-20161109-161805.log is from the above git-2016-11-08-1bbb18f version.

I have also confirmed a very similar fault, perhaps the same issue, in earlier versions 2.7.2 and 2.1.3
